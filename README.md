## Minesweeper Classic ##

A classic puzzle game where you need to avoid hidden mines.
This program is writen by russian student Popov AV

## Game Features ##

- When opening a cell, all adjacent 3x3 cells are automatically revealed (except those containing mines)
- Attempting to open an already revealed cell will be ignored
- **Simple Rules**: 
  - `?` - Unexplored cell
  - `#` - Flagged cell (suspected mine)
  - `1-8` - Number of adjacent mines
  - `*` - Mine (revealed when triggered)

## Developer Notes ##

I welcome all feedback and suggestions! Please feel free to open issues or contribute to the project.

I'm planning to Qt-based GUI implementation

I hope you enjoy the game! :)
